	* README.textile: Reformat without line breaks

2009-12-12  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README.md, README.textile: Try textile for readme

2009-12-12  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README.md, README.redcloth: Try using .md extension for doc.

2009-11-29  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/behave.el: Add assert-raises.

2009-11-25  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/behave.el: behave.el: fix incorrect initialization on
	*behave-total-assertions*.

2009-11-24  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/behave.el: Show number of assertions run.

2009-11-22  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Add provision for getting __FILE__ when we are
	byte compiling.

2009-11-22  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el, test/require-file2.el, test/require-file3.el,
	test/test-load.el: Add optional prefix to require-relative,
	require-relative and provide-me which will add that prefix to the
	feature name.

2009-11-22  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/test-load.el: Minimal test of provide-me.

2009-11-22  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Doc string fix.

2009-11-21  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am, README, README.redcloth: Turn README back into text.
	Add special redcloth version.

2009-11-21  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README, README.markup: Nope changing the name made things worse.

2009-11-21  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README, README.markup: See if changing the name from README to
	README.markup gives github a clue

2009-11-21  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README, load-relative.el: load-relative.el: Add provide-me and
	make GPL v3.  README: expand and turn into red-cloth markup.

2009-11-19  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/test-load.el: Another test of (__FILE__). Make test-load more
	eval-current'able.

2009-11-19  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/test-load.el: Add first __FILE__ test.

2009-11-17  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Bug: was not require-relative when not at
	compile time.

2009-11-15  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Working towards a more perfect __FILE__. Perhaps
	I am flailing here. Need much better tests.

2009-11-15  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am, load-relative.el, test/test-require-list.el: Add
	macro to handle relative requires using a list. And use this list
	eval-when-compile to remove the undefined function messages in
	byte-compilation.

2009-11-13  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Go over __FILE__ test ordering and more comments
	to as to why we do what we do.

2009-11-13  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Update __FILE__ docstring comment.

2009-11-13  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Also try #$ - "the name of this file as a
	string". Thanks due to grischka for the suggestion.

2009-11-13  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/require-file1.el: Used in testing require-relative

2009-11-13  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el, test/load-file2.el, test/test-load.el: 
	load-relative.el: Use current-load-list to get loaded/eval'd file
	name. It is perhaps is the most reliable but also the most low-level
	and it is an undocumented API. Update doc strings to record what we
	now understand. Allow an optional symbol -- just in case. Update
	tests.

2009-11-12  rocky <rocky@ubuntu-vm.(none)>

	* test/behave.el, test/test-load.el: test-load.el: add a
	require-relative test behave.el: sync up with emacs-dbgr - one bug
	removed.

2009-11-12  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el: Add require-relative.

2009-11-10  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el, test/behave.el, test/test-load.el: test-load.el:
	I think we need to expand the filename before calling load.
	behave.el: reduce dependency on spec part.

2009-11-09  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* load-relative.el, test/load-file1.el, test/test-load.el: Allow
	load-relative to accept a list of strings of files to load.

2009-11-09  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* Relative loads for Emacs Lisp files. Adds functions __FILE__ and
	load-relative.
